# Smallest_Multiple
From Project Euler Problem 5: 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible with no remainder by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

## Divisible Numbers
1. 2520/10 = 252
2. 2520/9 = 280
3. 2520/8 = 315
4. 2520/7 = 360
5. 2520/6 = 420
6. 2520/5 = 504
7. 2520/4 = 630
8. 2520/3 = 840
9. 2520/2 = 1260
10. 2520/1 = 2520

### Programming Language of Choice
Python

#### Ideas
1. Make a For Loop that goes from 1 to 20 where it will continue calculating until it finds the smallest divisor.
2. May need to use a nested for loop to solve the problem
3. Will probably need to use the min library.
